The tool/script is not tested yet! Modify it if you need to. 

Pylunarvim creates a file, writes a python shebang on it. And then gives execution permissions to the owner on it. Also, it adds work place to the PATH variable, so you can just run your projects by just calling its name on the terminal command line, like so: pylunarvim. Get ready to code a lot!
