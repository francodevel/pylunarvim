The tool/script is not tested yet! Modify it if you need to. 

Pylunarvim creates a file, writes a python shebang on it. And then it gives execute rights to the user that created the file, so the file can be executed by the user owner. Also, it adds work place to the PATH variable, so you can just run your own scripts by calling it by its name, on the terminal command line. Get ready to code a lot!
